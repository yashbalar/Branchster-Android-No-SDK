Branchster-Android-Demo-Application
==================

## Installing and running App directly
You can run the App directly by downloading and installing the app-release.apk file following the steps below:

1. Download **app-release.apk** file which exists in the *app/release* folder.
2. Install using the command: adb install -r app-release.apk

## Configuring Keys and Secrets
This repository does not contain API keys so you need to define your own in order for the connected APIs to function. Keys are defined as XML string resources and referenced at build-time. If you build the project as-is, you will get something like the following error:

```
Error: .. No resource found that matches the given name (at 'value' with value '@string/..').
```

To set up your own API keys and get rid of this error:

1. Open up **api_keys.xml** which exists in the */res/values* folder.
2. Insert your Branch App Key in this file.
3. Clean/Rebuild your project.

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

<string name="bnc_app_key">YOUR BRANCH APP KEY</string>

</resources>
